        "It is a branch of mathmatics concerned with the analysis of decision-making and strategy. It is applied in economics,biology and behavioral science. Game theory is used to determine different strategy to compete with one another. Game theory is also used in everyday life to make decision like when to change lanes in traffic, when to cross the road or even when to do your assignment.\n",

        "Game theory gained widespread recognition in early $1940's$ when it was applied to the theoretical study of economics by mathematician john von JOHN VON NEWMANN and the economist OSKAR MORGENSTERN in their book $THEORY$ $OF$ $GAMES$ $AND$ $ECOMONIC$ $BENAVIOR$. since then its scopes broadened to co-operative interaction as well as in applied theoretical aspects of social sciences. \n",
